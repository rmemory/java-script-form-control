This project is an example of usage of JavaScript, jQuery, basic bootstrap, and HTML forms.

There are no fancy graphics here, and in fact nothing more than a pretty basic usage of Bootstrap. But, 
it is a decent example of Java Script modules, jQuery usage, simple validation, and promises and deferreds.
